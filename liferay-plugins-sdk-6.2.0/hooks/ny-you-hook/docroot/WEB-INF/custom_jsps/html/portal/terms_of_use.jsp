					<strong>ACCESS Terms of Use</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Welcome to the ACCESS Knowledge Commons ("<strong>ACCESS</strong>"
					or the "<strong>Service</strong>"), a service provided by New York
					University for the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research community.
					The ACCESS Knowledge Commons is a peer-to-peer knowledge-sharing
					platform designed for members of the global PCOR community to
					develop and share information in the form of digital lessons. The
					nature of the lessons can be both social and educational and may
					include text, video and audio.
				</p>
				<p id="yui_patched_v3_11_0_7_1427807552181_61">
					Please read these Terms of Use carefully, because, together with
					the ACCESS Privacy Statement <a href="javascript:void(0)"
						style="text-decoration: underline;"
						onclick="makePrivacyStateMentVisible()">Privacy Statement</a>
					they constitute the entire agreement ("Agreement") between you and
					NYU governing your use of the ACCESS service. If you do not assent
					to this Agreement, you are not authorized to use the Service. By
					using the Service after assenting to these terms, you confirm that
					you agree to them.
				</p>
				
				<p id="yui_patched_v3_11_0_7_1427807552181_37">
					<strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Accounts and
						Security</strong>.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>ACCESS is available for public
					use. You are responsible for all activities that occur in
					connection with your account and for maintaining the security of
					your account. You should take reasonable steps to guard the
					security of your account, including by keeping the username and
					password for your account confidential. You may not transfer your
					account or otherwise do anything to give another person access to
					it.

					The Service and its contents, including User Content defined below
					("<strong>Service Content</strong>") are protected by United States
					and international copyright laws. You may access the Service and
					Service Content for your informational and personal educational use
					solely as intended through the provided functionality of the
					Service and as permitted under this Agreement. You may not download
					any Service Content, but you may embed certain User Content for
					which we make embed code available to you ("Embeddable Content"),
					provided that you comply with all the applicable terms of this
					Agreement. You may not copy, distribute, transmit, publicly
					display, publicly perform, modify, sell or transfer, create
					derivative works from, or in any other way exploit, any of the
					Service Content (including any programs, code, or software
					contained therein) in any manner, whether in whole or in part, for
					any other reason, except as explicitly permitted by this Agreement.
				</p>
				<p id="yui_patched_v3_11_0_7_1427807552181_38">The embed
					features of the Service are for your personal, non-commercial use
					only. If you use the embed features of the Service, you must not:
					(1) modify the provided embed code or any application, code, or
					features of the embed features, (2) charge a fee for or related to
					access to Embeddable Content, (3) present Embeddable Content or
					your website in a way that seeks to pass off your website as
					affiliated with or endorsed by us, or (4) make automated or
					excessive requests for Embeddable Content.</p>

					<strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Your

					knowledge via the creation of lessons, which may include videos,
					graphics, and text, (ii) to engage in discussions, and (iii)
					otherwise make content available through the Service, including
					profile information. The content provided by users to the Service
					is referred to in this Agreement as "<strong>User Content</strong>".

					User Content, you are entirely responsible for that User Content.
					You represent and warrant that (i) you have all of the rights
					necessary to submit your User Content to the Service and for NYU to
					use it in connection with the Service; (ii) your User Content does
					not and will not violate this Agreement or any third party's
					copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, right to privacy or
					publicity, or any other proprietary, personal, or other right of
					any kind; and (iii) you are under no obligation that would in any
					way interfere with or prohibit disclosure or use of your User
					Content.
				<p style="margin-left: 60px;">
					<strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>License
						to NYU</strong>.&nbsp; For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights
					in the User Content you provide. By submitting User Content to the
					Service, you grant NYU a non-exclusive, royalty free, worldwide
					license to use the User Content in connection with the Service in
					accordance with this Agreement (including the <a
						href="javascript:void(0)" style="text-decoration: underline;"
						onclick="makePrivacyStateMentVisible()"> Privacy Statement</a>),
					in all formats and media in which the Service is available, which
					use includes but is not limited to reproducing, distributing,
					transmitting, publicly displaying and performing, modifying,
					translating, and incorporating the User Content into a collective
					work and embedding the User Content in third-party websites.
				</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 60px;">You may remove User
					Content from the Service by pressing the "Delete" button associated
					with that User Content. However, please note that (1) Users can
					remove lessons but not comments, and (2) if a User has made their
					lesson materials available for use by other Users (as described in
					Section 2.c below), the materials will remain available in any
					other lesson that has used the material.</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 60px;">
					By posting User Content on the Service, you grant NYU the
					right to use your name for the purpose of attributing the User
					Content to you. You irrevocably release (on behalf of yourself and
					your successors, heirs, and executors) NYU from any claim of any
					nature that you have or may ever have (based on any cause of
					action, including rights of publicity or privacy, trademark or
					service mark, copyright, libel, or defamation) arising out of NYU's
					use, as described in this Agreement, of (i) User Content you
					provide or (ii) your name or likeness in connection with your User
					Content. If you are a California resident, you waive California
					Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not
					extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to
					exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release,
					which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or
					her settlement with the debtor." If you reside in any other
					jurisdiction that places similar restrictions on a general release,
					you waive those restrictions to the maximum extent permissible
					under the applicable law.
				</p>
			
				<p style="margin-left: 60px;">Our display of User
					Content does not mean that NYU endorses or adopts it. We have no
					obligation to display or use any User Content in any way or to
					pre-screen, monitor, modify, or delete User Content, but we may do
					so at any time without notice, including in the event that any User
					Content that violates this Agreement, our community guidelines, or
					the law. We are not responsible for any failure or delay in
					removing User Content that does not comply with this Agreement. We
					reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the
					Service, or otherwise restrict you from submitting new User Content
					or accessing the Service for any reason, including but not limited
					to repeated violations of this Agreement.</p>

					Service, regardless of the theory of liability, whether tort
					(including negligence), contract, or any other legal or equitable
					theory. Some states do not allow the limitation of liability for
					these kinds of damages, so these limitations or exclusions may not
					apply to you.</p>

					designed to promote knowledge exchange and interaction in the

					<strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Profile and
							Activity Information.</u></strong>&nbsp; Some of the User Information you supply
					for your Profile and your activity on ACCESS Knowledge Commons will be
					viewable by other ACCESS Knowledge Commons users. Information on your
					profile that is visible is your name, profile picture, about me, rank,
					participation and contribution statistics. For example, when you post
					a lesson or contribute to a discussion, other users will see your
					participation. In addition, certain features of the Service aggregate
					users' participation; for example, (1) clicking on a user's name
					permits other ACCESS Knowledge Commons users to see all of that user's
					lessons and requests, and (2) the "Contributor" page on ACCESS
					Knowledge Commons lists the top ACCESS Knowledge Commons contributors.
					<u>Your activity in private groups on ACCESS Knowledge Commons

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 60px;">
					<strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Sharing

					personal information, except as described in this Statement, unless
					disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to: (1) comply with
					legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal
					subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce
					this Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of
					third parties; (4) respond to customer service inquiries; or (5)
					protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the NYU community
					or NYU.
				</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 60px;">NYU
					may use third-party service providers ("Service Providers") to provide
					certain services necessary for ACCESS's operations and may share User

					it and will access your User Information only for the purpose of
					providing services to NYU. (See "Security" below.)</p>

					<strong>ACCESS Knowledge Commons Privacy Statement</strong>

				<p>
					New York University ("NYU") is committed to respecting your privacy.
					NYU's <a href="javascript:void(0)"
						style="text-decoration: underline;"
						onclick="makePrivacyStateMentVisible()">Digital Web and Mobile Privacy
						Statement</a> governs the collection and use of information collected
					through official NYU websites and other NYU digital properties. This
					Privacy Statement is a part of the ACCESS Knowledge Commons Terms of
					Use ("Agreement") and supplements the Digital Web and Mobile Privacy
					Statement.
				</p>
				<p id="yui_patched_v3_11_0_7_1427807552181_61">This Privacy
					Statement describes how we collect and use your information in
					connection with ACCESS Knowledge Commons and the choices you can make
					regarding your information. The purpose of ACCESS Knowledge Commons is
					to share content with the ACCESS community and the public, and
					therefore much of the information you share and your activity on
					ACCESS Knowledge Commons may be seen by any visitor. By using ACCESS
					Knowledge Commons and providing User Information to us, you expressly
					and voluntarily accept the terms and conditions of this ACCESS
					Knowledge Commons Privacy Statement and the Agreement of which it is a
					part.
				</p>
				<p id="yui_patched_v3_11_0_7_1427807552181_37">We may modify this
					ACCESS Knowledge Commons Privacy Statement, along with the rest of the
					Agreement, in our sole discretion. We will notify you of any changes
					in a manner commensurate with the nature of the changes (e.g., by
					posting a notice to the ACCESS Knowledge Commons Service or by
					contacting you directly).
				</p>
			
				<p>
					<strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information We
						Collect</strong>&nbsp;<br /> In this Privacy Statement, the personal
					information you provide to ACCESS Knowledge Commons and your activity
					on the Service that we record is referred to as "User Information".
				</p>
				
				<p style="margin-left: 60px;">
					<strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Your Account
							Profile.</u></strong>&nbsp; When you sign in to ACCESS Knowledge Commons, your
					ACCESS Knowledge Commons profile is completed with your name and your
					enrollment details. This information will be visible on your ACCESS
					Knowledge Commons account profile ("Profile"). You may choose to
					complete additional fields in your Profile with information that you
					provide. Please do not post any personal identification numbers or
					other private information not required for registering for or using
					the Service. You can review the information you provided for your
					Profile and make changes to that information at any time by clicking
					on the "User Profile" link in the top-right corner of every page.
					After your change is processed, NYU may retain residual copies of the
					old information in its backup and archival copies of its database for
					a limited period of time.
				</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 60px;">
					<strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Your
							Activity.</u></strong>&nbsp; We also collect information about your use of ACCESS
					Knowledge Commons. For example, we collect information about your
					activity on ACCESS Knowledge Commons, including the lessons you have
					created, groups of which you are a member, contacts you have made, and
					lessons and discussions you have participated in. This activity
					information is included in the definition of your "User Information".
					This activity is connected to your account and can be viewed by other
					ACCESS Knowledge Commons users as described in Section 2.
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					<strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uses of Your
						Information in Your Profile; Sharing User Information with Third
						Parties</strong> <br />ACCESS Knowledge Commons is a collaborative platform
					designed to promote knowledge exchange and interaction in the
					community. As a result, much of your activity and communication that
					takes place within ACCESS Knowledge Commons is openly visible to any
					visitor to ACCESS Knowledge Commons. This section describes how
					certain User Information will be made available on ACCESS Knowledge
					Commons.
				</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 60px;">
					<strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Profile and
							Activity Information.</u></strong>&nbsp; Some of the User Information you supply
					for your Profile and your activity on ACCESS Knowledge Commons will be
					viewable by other ACCESS Knowledge Commons users. Information on your
					profile that is visible is your name, profile picture, about me, rank,
					participation and contribution statistics. For example, when you post
					a lesson or contribute to a discussion, other users will see your
					participation. In addition, certain features of the Service aggregate
					users' participation; for example, (1) clicking on a user's name
					permits other ACCESS Knowledge Commons users to see all of that user's
					lessons and requests, and (2) the "Contributor" page on ACCESS
					Knowledge Commons lists the top ACCESS Knowledge Commons contributors.
					<u>Your activity in private groups on ACCESS Knowledge Commons
						will be viewable only by other ACCESS Knowledge Commons users in that
						group.</u>
				</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 60px;">In
					your user profile if you check the box labeled "Make me anonymous in
					trending and other matrix activities as I don't wish to participate,"
					the following information will be made anonymous: trending, gaming
					statistics, contributor ranking and who else viewed this lesson.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 60px;">
					<strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Sharing
							Information with Third Parties.</u></strong>&nbsp; NYU takes the privacy of the
					NYU community very seriously, and we do not sell, rent, or share your
					personal information, except as described in this Statement, unless
					disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to: (1) comply with
					legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal
					subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce
					this Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of
					third parties; (4) respond to customer service inquiries; or (5)
					protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the NYU community
					or NYU.
				</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 60px;">NYU
					may use third-party service providers ("Service Providers") to provide
					certain services necessary for ACCESS's operations and may share User
					Information with those Service Providers. We will take all reasonable
					measures to ensure that those Service Providers will not disclose User
					information to third parties or any employee without the need to know
					it and will access your User Information only for the purpose of
					providing services to NYU. (See "Security" below.)</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					<strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children Under Age
						13</strong> <br />ACCESS Knowledge Commons is not intended for use by
					children under the age of 13. By using the Service, you represent to
					us that you are at least 13 years old. If you are not at least 13
					years old, you may not use the Service. NYU does not knowingly collect
					personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
